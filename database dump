It is located in an extremely central location, just next to Jianguomen, and is within the confines of the city's 2nd Ring Road. Trains enter and leave to the scenery of a former Beijing city gate at Dongbianmen.%r%rThe traffic load of Beijing Railway Station has decreased somewhat with the opening of the Beijing West Railway Station in 1996. Still, it remains a busy railway station, handling trains to and from northern and coastal southern China. Some international lines (notably the railway line linking Beijing to Pyongyang, North Korea (DPRK), amongst others), also depart from this station."

I'm resetting Modern Command, in preparation for actual beta testing! In this vein, it is very important no one does anything with their nations. In fact, you might expect your nation association to change. The idea now is to act like new players, and try playing this game! I've made some substantial changes over the last few days, and look for more to come. 

Please @mail any questions to me.

Enjoy!

2) Changed gnn to be readable
3) chy+cgreligc/ is now more friendly about input, and I've begun the long process of standardizing input - so all commands are typed in bascially the same way :-)
4) Added rhetoric system. Essentially, players can now raise and lower levels of rhetoric.
5) The trade system now cleans up expired trade agreements
6) we are now running 183p6. Thanks to the devteam at pennmush for all their work
7) Vastly simplified chy+jobsc/
8) We have implemented Myrddin's Global BBS v4.0.6. This replaces an SQL-based system Cooee kindly wrote for us a while ago. However, considering my limited activity on this game, I wanted to have a full-featured system available to people who would likely know how to use it - so I installed Myrddin's Global BBS. I used the help files available on Myrddin's site - and they are now nestled in with our other help files. I hope to install anomoly's job system shortly."

Ok. Everything has been reset. Character generation, points, nation status, treaties, agreements, everything. I'm going to ask that you keep a freeze on everything while I iron out a few more bugs, and fix some stupid stuff that came up when I was resetting everything. 

After this, I'll ask you to create new characters, (we aren't doing a purge, but I want fresh faces) and start setting up your nations. 

The really key things to pay attention to are: 

1) code problems
2) Potential new-player confusion (could something be clearer?)
3) spelling mistakes (there are many)
4) and of course, is this fun.

I'll chime in with a longer status report when I've fixed the annoying little issues. 

Enjoy!!

2) Added information to the footer of IC rooms when the description was swiped from wikipedia (+source)
3) Deleted everyone's points, all character generation stuff, sanctions, scandals, etc...
4) Changed deployment messages so if a nation didn't have deployments, an appropriate IC message is generated 
5) Changed hardcoded help to include our softcoded +help system
6) Cleaned up +range code
7) Cleaned up +conv code - it now does a little more checking of user input
8) When a player reduces a priority, the effectivness of that priority is reduced
9) +diplo <nation> now provides agreement and treaty information
10) Removed some old commands and old help files

There are a couple of big jobs left:

1) I have to re-write +gnn. Basically, I want the gnn stuff to spit into Myrddin's Global BBS. technically, it's not to hard, but there are many objects that generate messages. I also want to make the messages slightly more verbose and sometimes funny. heh.
2) +advisors. this is a very important part of the game, especially for new players. I want an IC coded advisor who can make suggestions to help new players get started. 
3) I need to document some commands, especially the +nation commands, which are huge.
4) finally, I need to populate the nations with basic priorities, military assets, etc, in preparation for our first round beta test."

5) Changed +cgat to remove cost, which we don't use here quite yet. Actually, all skills, merits and attributes have a cost associated with them, but this isn't part of the game quite yet.
6) Changed the +priority help a little bit, and tweaked the syntax a bit.
 7) Updated +help +treaty...if there are empty values, this is friendlier output
8) when the cycle ticks, treaties increment.
9) Cleaned up +treaty/status <nation> and +treaty/pending

So I'm still poking at +gnn, and I need to write a channel system for diplomatic relations."

1) Added an +insult command, with compliments to mushcode.com

5) Added +rules death. Probably worth reading.
6) +channel/invite <player>=<channel> allows you to invite players to your channel.
7) With great reluctance, I did a player purge. Basically, everyone who hasn't connected in a long time was @nuked.
8) +jobs now accepts jobs from non-admin players, so anyone can add job or bugreport

I'm happy to report another round of changes.

1. Upon connect to Modern Command, players automatically check the +board for any new posts
2. Removed some merits and flaws
3. Added in generic descriptions for all the airports, another important part of the new player experience
4. Made +help +bio clearer (thanks Erik!)
5. oops! unlocked +pub and +united nations channels
6. Spiffed up the travel system a bit. I neeed to think about +travel a bit more, as it's currently instantanous.
7. @dug Mongolia. oops. 
8. Fixed the +sheet for players - it wasn't showing flaws correctly.

I'm happy to report I'm starting to work on the +advisor system - and big news here, I've decided to use natural language AND normal mush syntax. If I'm lucky I'll have a decent +advisor system in 2 weeks or so."

FIX: +points wasn't working quite right, and now it is.
FIX: forgot to set admin-related attributes on mortal players as mortal_dark. oops.
FIX: military priorities weren't updating on each cycle tick. Now they are.
FIX: when players chose a nation, their research points weren't set.
FIX: When adding a new research item, the text was screwed up
FIX: If a player mistyped an economic priority, the error message was wrong. fixed.
FIX: there was a debug message in the research code, when a player tried to add a new priority, and doesn't have enough points.
FIX: Changed chy+help +pric/ to show players how to see the priorities they've set
FIX: spiffed up chy+nation/summary <nation>c/
FIX: cycle now honors economic buildings, increments the effect of your buildings each turn
FIX: fixed an issue when priorities were higher than 101. Heh.


SETUP ISSUE: all nations currently have a military production level of 5. This is quite obviously, stupid. One thing we need to do is decide what nations should have high levels and what nations should have low levels. I was laughing as Mongolia was producing the same technological level as Germany

As I continue to play as a normal mortal player, I'm sure I'll disover and fix more bugs!

Enjoy!

1. FIX: building efficacy is incremented each cycle tick
2. FIX: reduced the number of credits players got when logging in
3. FIX: When deleteing a priority, we have better IC description.

4. CHANGE: updated chy+help +jobsc/ so players could add a job.
5. CHANGE: Players can buy military training - chy+nation/summary <nation>c/ now reflects different levels of training, and only currently active units benefit from training. Cool, huh?
6. CHANGE: Removed optional CG. There are so many important attributes and points are put on a player during CG. We have kept in cg kits, which allows players to choose a template for a character.
7. CHANGE: Added more political and economic indicators. These are very important metrics, as they define the profile of a nation. See chy+info <nation>c/ for our current indicators
8. CHANGE: pruned some tables in the database. As I've mentioned before, there are hundreds of undocumented commands here, and once modern command gets up and running, I will be optimizing and optimizing!
9. CHANGE: All nations now have GDP per capita (PPP US$). I couldn't find the data for all nations, so I made best guesses.
10. CHANGE: Added literacy rates for every nation on Modern Command. Whee!
11. CHANGE: Business climate has been added for all nations. \"Business climate is the ability to create, operate, and close an enterprise quickly and easily. Burdensome, redundant regulatory rules are the most harmful barriers to business freedom\" (source: http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/Index2008_Chap4.pdf)
12. CHANGE: Trade climate has been added for all nations. \"Trade climate is a composite measure of the absence of tariff and non-tariff barriers that affect imports and exports of goods and services\" (source: http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/Index2008_Chap4.pdf)

The end of the school year has made me busy, but I am happy to report the following fixes and changes to Modern Command:

1. Added Financial policies for every country
2. Added Military expenditures - percent of GDP for each nation. 
3. Added Government size for every nation. Government size is defined to include all government expenditures, including consumption and transfers. (http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/Index2008_Chap4.pdf)
4. added property rights for each nation. Property rights is an assessment of the ability of individuals to accumulate private property, secured by clear laws that are fully enforced by the state. (http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/Index2008_Chap4.pdf)
5. Added corruption index. Freedom from corruption is based on quantitative data that assess the perception of corruption in the business environment, including levels of governmental legal, judicial, and administrative corruption. (source: http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/Index2008_Chap4.pdf)
6. The formatting was screwy in +nation/summary - fixed.
7. changing political priorities is now more descriptive and IC.
8. military priorities are now incrementing each cycle tick
9. Fixed bug after choosing a nation.
10. +treaty was screwed up, and now it's fixed. Thank you Erik!
11. +ic / +ooc was screwed up, and now it's fixed.
12. fixed some syntax issues in chargen - thanks cooee!

I'm still hacking away - and love working on the game. Please continue to submit requests and suggestions. I'm tackling them as best as I can."

  value "Alan Schwartz, Associate Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago (and known around MUSHes as Javelin, former PennMUSH developer), is seeking players to participate in an 5-minute anonymous survey as part of a study of the interconnections between MUSHes and MUSH players. This project has been determined to be exempt from review by the UIC Institutional Review Board.

The survey will ask you to indicate which of a list of MUSHes you currently play or staff on, as well as a few optional demographic questions. You will not be asked to provide your name. Responses to the survey will be used to better understand how MUSH are connected by players in common and how players are connected by MUSHes in common.

To participate in this project, visit: http://javelin.pennmush.org/survey/

For further questions, you may contact Alan via email at alansz@uic.edu or javelin@pennmush.org.

Thanks for your help!

  value "Short black hair cut at the shoulders and a friendly demeanor characterize this attractive African-American woman. Large brown eyes look out from behind a fashionable pair of gold half-glasses. She has a small gap in her two front teeth only obvious because she is usually smiling. She is about 5 foot 9 inches 1.79 meters tall and looks like she weighs about 170 pounds 79.37 Kilograms . She has dark brown flawless skin and is usually wearing an attracitve gold pair of half-earings. She walks with determination and purpose and when she listens and speaks does so with a very deliberate intensity.

Wearing:

Green tweed jacket with a slightly wrinkled white shirt. A loosened neck tie hangs around their neck, and the top button of the shirt is unfastened. Khaki pants, held up by a simple faded leather belt fit well and hang loosely. Slightly worn brown shoes complete the outfit."

Now, it is a beautiful place where many people frequent.%r%rAll the major organs of the government are reasonably near the square.

The Chamber measures 14 by 21 m (46 by 68 ft). It is far more austere than the Lords' Chamber; the benches, as well as other furnishings in the Commons side of the Palace, are coloured green. Members of the public are forbidden to sit on the green benches. Other parliaments in Commonwealth nations have copied the colour scheme under which the Lower House is associated with green, and the Upper House with red.%r%rAt one end of the Chamber is the Speaker's Chair, a present to Parliament from Australia. In front of the Speaker's Chair is the Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, and on which is placed the Commons' ceremonial mace. The dispatch boxes, which front bench MPs often lean on or rest notes on during Questions and speeches, are a gift from New Zealand. There are green benches on either side of the house; members of the Government party occupy benches on the Speaker's right, whilst those of the Opposition occupy benches on the Speaker's left. There are no cross-benches as in the House of Lords. The Chamber is relatively small, and can accommodate only 427 of the 646 Members of Parliament. During Prime Minister's Questions and in major debates Members of Parliament stand at either end of the House."

The upper part of the Chamber is decorated by stained glass windows and by six allegorical frescoes representing religion, chivalry and law. The upper part, or the viewing gallery, features a small curtain, around ten inches high. This was constructed in the 1920s to hide the ankles and lower legs of viewing women; fashion was becoming increasingly promiscuous, as they saw it, and the sight of bare legs was deemed unsuitable for Lords."

  value "Palace of WestminsterThe Palace of Westminster, also known as the Houses of Parliament or Westminster Palace, in London, England is where the two Houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (the House of Lords and the House of Commons) meet to conduct their business. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the London borough of the City of Westminster, close by other government buildings in Whitehall.%r%rThe oldest part of the Palace still in existence, Westminster Hall, dates from 1097. The palace originally served as a royal residence but no monarch has lived in it since the 16th century (although on the night before coronation, the sovereign sleeps in the bed of the Speaker of the House of Commons). Most of the present structure dates from the 19th century, when the Palace was rebuilt after it was almost entirely destroyed by a fire in 1834. The architects responsible for rebuilding the Palace were Sir Charles Barry and Augustus Welby Pugin. The building is an example of Gothic revival. One of the Palace's most famous features is the clock tower, a tourist attraction that houses the famous bell Big Ben. The latter name is often used, erroneously, for the clock itself.%r%rThe Palace contains over 1,000 rooms, the most important of which are the Chambers of the House of Lords and of the House of Commons. The Palace also includes committee rooms, libraries, lobbies, dining-rooms, bars and gymnasiums. It is the site of important state ceremonies, most notably the State Opening of Parliament. The Palace is very closely associated with the two Houses, as shown by the use of the word \"Westminster\" to refer to \"Parliament\". Parliamentary offices also occupy nearby buildings such as Portcullis House, the Parliament Street building, Fielden House, no.7 Millbank and the two Norman Shaw Buildings. All these buildings form the Parliamentary Estate."

The original name was to have been \"King William the Fourth's Square\", but George Ledwell Taylor suggested the name \"Trafalgar Square\".%r%rThe northern area of the square had been the site of the King's Mews since the time of Edward I, while the southern end was the original Charing Cross, where the Strand from the City met Whitehall, coming north from Westminster. As the midpoint between these twin cities, Charing Cross is to this day considered the heart of London, from which all distances are measured.%r%rIn the 1820s the Prince Regent engaged the landscape architect John Nash to redevelop the area. Nash cleared the square as part of his Charing Cross Improvement Scheme. The present architecture of the square is due to Sir Charles Barry and was completed in 1845.%r%rThe square, a popular site for political demonstrations, is the site of Nelson's Column, and related sculptures of note."

  value "You find this hispanic-looking male to be a bit taller than average -1.83 meters- and a bit thinner too -75 kilograms-. His light complexion added to his sharp features make him look rather fragile. But his white skin has good color and overall it seems he is in a healthy condition. Some clearings begin to appear among his straight dark brown hair. He has ebony black eyes a round nose with an elegant moustache right below it and a fine mouth with sharp corners. His walk and manners show him as a very energic man.

Wearing:

A two-button, non-vented jacket is appropriately traditional and double-pleated slacks are lined to the knee, ensuring comfort and a proper drape. The suit is impeccably tailored. Lap pockets and a center vent create a quintessential business look. A windsor knot with subtle colors falls down a perfectly white shirt. Patent leather black wingtip shoes complete the suit."

Red buses and cars rush around the big square full of tourists, statues of past spanish kings, and shops. From here, the Metro (Underground) network spreads, and there is a road around the place connecting it with some important streets. You can see the Plaza Mayor, another important and historical square, just some meters away. Advertisings, bus stops, pedestrians, and a press kiosk also inhabit the square."

Richard wrote the very first MUD, and as such, his thinking is quite valuable about the topic. %r%rI want the admin team to understand why people play MUSH'es.  I want the team to understand that Modern Command will be a truly [ansi(u,great)] game if we respond to different players differently.%r%rGot a hack-and-slash type? Give them a Chechnia-style rebellion! Got an explorer-type? Give them a mystery, or maybe an exploration tinyplot. %r%rThe point I'm trying to make here, is the better we know our players, the better we will be able to repsond to them. %r%rThank you again for thinking about this."

  value "I don't want Modern Command to be a time sink for the playerbase.  I think one of the failings of contemporary MUSHes is the unwritten expectation that more time=more success.  I just don't think it's wise to expect our playerbase to spend 20 and 30 hours a week here (leave that to WoW). %r%rWhen crafting tinyplots, scenerios, major events, and challenges for our players, keep in mind it's wise decisions and effective delegation which will win the day - not raw time. We should reward smart playing, shrewd strategies, and consistent commitment to a political philosophy. %r%rThis get's a little bit tricky.%r%rIf a player IS spending a ton of time here, and contributing a lot, then they should be rewarded (XP, in-game bonuses, etc). But we should always keep in mind the players who only spend an hour or a two per week here - how can we best accomodate them?"

There should be coded systems which allow the player to face challenges, to resolve conflicts, and to keep track of important events. While I don't want Modern Command to be a MUD, which is totally coded, I want Modern Command to be playable without a bunch of other players on.%r%rThis is, of course, a very difficult thing to do well.%r%rPlayers should be able to initiate military actions, start economic initiatives, offer trade agreements, and initiate political reforms...all within the coded system sphere. But players should have a [ansi(u,much richer)] experience when role playing.  I still don't have clarity about this, so I'll be juggling RP and coded systems. However, my goal is to have a balanced code vs role play system."

Originally named the New Park, the public quickly started calling the park Vondelpark after a statue of the writer was placed, and eventually the name was adopted officially. Until 1953, the park was owned by the Vereniging tot aanleg van een rij- en wandelpark (Society for creating a park for riding and strolling). When they could no longer afford to maintain the park, they donated it to the city of Amsterdam."

  value "This house,  and the one next door at number 265, which was later purchased by the museum  were built by Dirk van Delft in 1635. The canal-side facade dates from a renovation of 1739 when the rear annex was demolished and the taller one which now stands in its place was built. It was originally a private residence, then a warehouse, and in the nineteenth century, the front warehouse with its wide stable-like doors was used to house horses. At the start of the 20th century a manufacturer of household appliances occupied the building, succeeded in 1930 by a producer of piano rolls, who vacated the property by 1939. On December 1, 1940 Anne's father Otto Frank moved the offices of the spice and gelling companies he worked for, Opekta and Pectacon, from an address on the Singel canal to Prinsengracht 263.%r%rThe ground floor consisted of three sections; the front was the goods and despatch entrance, behind it in the middle section were the spice mills, and at the rear, which was the ground floor of the annexe, was the warehouse where the goods were packed for distribution. On the first floor above were the offices of Frank's employees; Miep Gies, Bep Voskuijl and Johannes Kleiman in the front office; Victor Kugler in the middle; with Otto Frank in the rear office above the warehouse and below the floors which would later hide him and his family for two years until their betrayal to the Nazi authorities."

The density of illuminated signs in Times Square now rivals that of Las Vegas. Officially, signs in Times Square are called \"spectaculars.\""

There are also major UN agencies in Geneva, The Hague, Vienna, Montreal, Copenhagen, Bonn, and elsewhere.%r%rAs the main UN building is aging, the UN is in the process of negotiating to build a temporary headquarters designed by Fumihiko Maki on First Avenue (Manhattan) between 41st and 42nd Streets for use while the current building is being expanded."

Helpful guides are ready at every turn, and security is everpresent. A massive brass logo of the United Nations hangs from the ceiling. A few school-groups tour the massive entrance, watched by ever-present chaperones."
