# moderncommand
was a text-based game which brought me many hours and days of joy and escape. I loved this game. 
Players could simulate a world leader and command your nation
Modern command could be accessed at moderncommand.com port 4201
From a command line: telnet moderncommand.com 4201

The problem with MUSH based games and many computer games is they don't have a satisfying end. I connect games to a story - there is an arc to the thing. 

Here's the final output, 10 November 2022 (after more than 20 years) :
